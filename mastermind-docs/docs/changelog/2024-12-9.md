## [Released]

- **Added:**
  - Docker and docker-compose.
  - PSQL database.
  - Tables for Game, Attempt, MatchRecord and User.
  - Rate limit so that users can only create 5 games per minute.
  - Connected endpoints to now use the database and tables.
- **Improved:**
  - Implemented Docker in order to facilitate the creation of the psql user and db that way if someone cloning the app doesn't have psql installed they can just rely on the docker container.
  - Added tests for the `game_state` object version of the app.
- **Fixed:**
  - Fixed validations
  - Reduced the possibilities of someone spamming the `Start Game Endpoint` by introducing a Rate Limiter.
