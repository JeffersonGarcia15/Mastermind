## [Released]

- **Added:**
  - Tests for the db version.
  - New `test_app`, `test_db` and `docker-compose-test.yml` to run tests in isolation.
  - Created documentation for the `Mastermind Game` using `Docusaurus`
- **Improved:**
  - API endpoints now rely on the PSQL db on Docker
- **Fixed:**
  - Added alternative way of generating a sequence to guess, when starting a game, so that if the `Random.org` API returns a 500 or is unavailable, we can generate the sequence locally.
