# Future Improvements

### **Planned Security Enhancements:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**

   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**

     - Implementing JWT-based authentication to securely manage user sessions.

   - **OAuth Integration:**

     - Providing options for users to authenticate via third-party providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).

   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
     - Defining user roles and permissions to control access to specific API endpoints and functionalities.

2. **Encryption:**

   - **Data in Transit:**

     - Enforcing HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between clients and the server, preventing [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/man-in-the-middle-attack-mitm/#:~:text=A%20man%20in%20the%20middle,exchange%20of%20information%20is%20underway.).

   - **Data at Rest:**
     - Encrypting sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials and game states.

3. **Security Headers:**
   - **HTTP Headers:**
     - Implementing security-related HTTP headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, Strict-Transport-Security) to enhance protection against common web vulnerabilities.
4. **Rate Limiting:**

   - **Preventing Abuse:**

     - Introducing rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single source.

   - **Tools:**
     - Utilizing Flask extensions like `Flask-Limiter` to manage rate limits effectively.

5. **Logging and Monitoring:**

   - **Health Check Service:**

     - Implement a service that is going to ping the `Game Service` with a counter or timestamp. If the timestamp and/or counter are not in order(counter going from say 1 to 10 and timestamp going from 12:00am to 12:10am) then we will check the Game service and determine potential issues with it.

   - **Activity Logs:**

     - Maintaining detailed logs of user activities and system events to detect and investigate suspicious behavior.

6. **Regular Security Audits:**

   - **Vulnerability Assessments:**

     - Conducting periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential security flaws.

   - **Dependency Scanning:**
     - Utilizing tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies. This is a great reading about how a corrupt library can affect your project.

7. **Secure Development Practices:**

   - **Code Reviews:**

     - Implementing rigorous code review processes to ensure that security best practices are followed.

   - **Static Code Analysis:**
     - Using static analysis tools to detect security issues early in the development cycle.

### **Future Considerations:**

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
  - Adding an additional layer of security for user accounts by requiring a second form of verification during login.
- **Data Backup and Recovery:**

  - Establishing secure data backup and recovery procedures to protect against data loss or corruption.
